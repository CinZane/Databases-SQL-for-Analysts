# Achievement 3 Databases & SQL for Analysts Careerfoundry
In this Project for the Data Analyst Immersion Course from Careerfoundry, we started to use and implement into Databases & SQL. 
We have been tasked to develop a Launch Strategie as a Streaming Service for a fictive Movie Rental Company that was facing Stiff Competition from Services such as Netflix or Amazon Prime.

# Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions theyâ€™d l ike to answer:
Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
What was the average rental duration for all videos?
Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?
Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

# We have created a Tableau Report based on the Key Questions and our findings from within the Data. The Report can be reviewed via the following Link
