# Databases & SQL for Analysts Careerfoundry Data Immersion Course

In this Project for the Data Analyst Immersion Course from Careerfoundry, i started to use and implement Databases & SQL. 
I have been tasked to develop a Launch Strategie as a Streaming Service for a fictive Movie Rental Company that was facing Stiff Competition from Services such as Netflix or Amazon Prime.

# Key Questions and Objectives

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions theyâ€™d l ike to answer:
Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
What was the average rental duration for all videos?
Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
Where are customers with a high l ifetime value based?
Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

I have created a Tableau Report based on the Key Questions and my findings from within the Data. The Report can be reviewed via the following Links below
